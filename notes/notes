Docker vs Docker-compose:
	Docker is used to manage individual containers while docker-compose can manage multiple containers. A container uses the host OS to run apps while a VM simulates a separate OS.

Docker image with and without Docker-compose:
	A docker image is like a snapshot in a VM, it is a record of a container at a specific point in time. Docker-compose prefixes the image name with the project name. 

Docker vs VM:
	Docker is much more lightweight than a VM so you don't need as much space to run docker as you would a VM. This also means that running a docker container is faster than running a VM. Furthermore, docker containers are much more portable than a VM, since they use the host OS to launch apps you can run them on any OS immediately. 

Pertinence of the directory structure:
	Subject requires it. 

Docker network:
	Docker networks is a way for the containers of communicating with eachother.
