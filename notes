Docker vs Docker-compose:
	Docker is used to manage individual containers while docker-compose can manage multiple containers. A container uses the host OS to run apps while a VM simulates a separate OS.

Docker image with and without Docker-compose:
	A docker image is like a snapshot in a VM, it is a record of a container at a specific point in time. Docker-compose prefixes the image name with the project name. 

Docker vs VM:
	Docker is much more lightweight than a VM so you don't need as much space to run docker as you would a VM. This also means that running a docker container is faster than running a VM. Furthermore, docker containers are much more portable than a VM, since they use the host OS to launch apps you can run them on any OS immediately. 

Pertinence of the directory structure:
	Subject requires it. 

Docker network:
	Docker networks is a way for the containers of communicating with eachother. 	

NGINX connect only through port 443, not port 80:
	Change settings to false in firefox otherwise firefox automatically redirects to https.
	network.stricttransportsecurity.preloadlist
	browser.fixup.fallback-to-https

Logging into the database:
	get container id:
		docker ps -a | grep Up | grep wordpress | awk '{print $1}'
	go into running container:
		docker exec -it container_id bash
	login to the database:
		mariadb -hmariadb -ulogin_name -plogin_password
	inside the database:
		show databases;
		use WP;
		select * from wp_comments;
